INTRODUCTION
============

Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic vision sensors, operate by mimicking how the human eye and brain process
visual information. Instead of capturing a series of still frames at fixed intervals like a traditional RGB camera,
an event camera detects changes in brightness at each pixel asynchronously. When something changes within its field
of view - such as an object moving past a background - the corresponding pixels send out "events" at that precise
instant, resulting in a continuous, time-based flow of information. This approach drastically reduces the amount of
redundant data and latency, making event cameras ideal for tasks that need fast and efficient responses, such as
robot navigation, automotive safety systems, and drones.

Compared to RGB cameras, which rely on frame-based captures and often generate large amounts of ddata - even when
nothing changes between frames - event cameras naturally encode changes only. RGB cameras are excellent for producing
detailed, easily interpretable color images, but this often comes with high computational demands and the need to
handle large, static datasets. Event cameras, in contrast, focus on what's happening and when, prioritizing motion
and timing rather than capturing full-scene snapshots. By providing a continuous stream of meaningful data, event
cameras are paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent vision systems.
